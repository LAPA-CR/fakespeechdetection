# **Research Ethics Pledge: Responsible AI & Audio Forensics**

**Project:** CR-FakeSpeech (Costa Rican Deepfake Detection)
**Version:** 1.0

### **Preamble**

Research into synthetic media ("Deepfakes"), Voice Conversion (VC), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies involves **dual-use** capabilities. While our goal is to build detection systems to protect the information ecosystem, the same tools can be misused to deceive, harass, or defraud.

As a contributor to this laboratory, you are granted access to powerful generative models and sensitive biometric data (voice recordings). This privilege comes with the responsibility to adhere to the highest ethical standards.

### **The Core Commitments**

By participating in this research, I pledge to adhere to the following principles:

#### **1. Informed Consent is Non-Negotiable**

* I will **never** clone, synthesize, or manipulate the voice of any individual without their explicit, written, and informed consent.
* I understand that "publicly available audio" (e.g., YouTube videos, podcasts) does **not** constitute consent for voice cloning, unless the individual is a public figure used *strictly* for internal detection benchmarking and never for dissemination.
* For the "Blue Team" (Real Audio Collection): I will ensure all participants sign the **Data Release Form** before recording.

#### **2. Prohibition of Malicious Use**

I will not use the software, code, or models provided by this lab to:

* Impersonate individuals for fraud or social engineering.
* Create content intended to defame, harass, or bully.
* Generate "Fake News" or disinformation for political or social manipulation.
* Bypass biometric security systems (e.g., voice authentication banks).

#### **3. Disclosure and Watermarking**

* I will clearly label all synthetic audio files generated within this project.
* I will not attempt to pass off synthetic audio as real human speech outside of specific, controlled "Turing Test" experiments approved by the Lab Director.
* Where technically feasible, I will apply inaudible watermarks to synthetic output to aid future detection.

#### **4. Data Privacy and Security**

* I will treat voice recordings as **biometric data**.
* I will not upload raw datasets or sensitive fine-tuned models to public, unmonitored repositories (e.g., public GitHub repos without LFS protection, random file sharing sites) without authorization.
* I will respect the "Right to be Forgotten": If a participant requests their data be removed, I will immediately delete their files from my local workspace.

### **Consequences of Violation**

I understand that violating this pledge compromises the integrity of the laboratory and the safety of the community. Consequences for verified violations may include:

1. Immediate revocation of access to the lab's repositories and computing resources.
2. Academic disciplinary action by the University.
3. Legal action if the violation involves defamation, fraud, or privacy infringement under Costa Rican law (e.g., *Ley de Protección de la Persona frente al Tratamiento de sus Datos Personales*).
